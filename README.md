## The task description
A mobile developer has made an app for the demiurge Shambambukli.
His friend Mazukta liked the application so much that he asked you to adapt it for WEB.
 
Creating a new world, the demiurge fills it with cells. Each time you click on the FAB in the application, a new one is added to the list of cells:

- it is equally probable that it can be both alive and dead;
- life arises if a living cell has been created twice in a row before;
- if a dead cell was born three times in a row, life dies nearby.
 
Android developer demiurge Shambamboukli has kindly shared the [mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/RNGiOtbn0Iiyjt82BwMXWX/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F-%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%B0-%D0%A8%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B8?node-id=0%3A1) with you.
